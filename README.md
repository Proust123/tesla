# Beginner Web Development Projects
 
 This repository contains a  simple web page I created while learning the basics of web development. This project were built using only **HTML** and **CSS**, without the use of 
 advanced layout techniques like **Flexbox**, **Grid**, or responsive design. They represent my early steps into web development and helped me understand how HTML structure and CSS 
 styling work together to create web pages.
